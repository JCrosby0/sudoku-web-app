### TODO:

## Bugs:

# undo redo stack -- fails after loading a puzzle

# check puzzle could (offer to) highlight bad cells

# reset puzzle should return it to the loaded state, not an empty grid

# some tab select / active region issues, ie click on body before can input

# E2E Cypress tests failing keyboard input for some reason

# Check function not returing errors properly

## Enhance:

# List out functionality required for grid decoration

# Set up data structure for regions (killer, thermo etc)

# color back ground inputs

# puzzle validation for additional rules

# Use OpenCV to interpret sudoku puzzle from image and populate grid
