### TODO:

## Set up data structure for current state of grid

# undo redo stack -- fails sometimes

# List out functionality required for grid decoration

# reset puzzle should return it to the loaded state, not an empty grid

# check puzzle could (offer to) highlight bad cells

# some tab select / active region issues, ie click on body before can input

# color back ground inputs

# reactive menu design // menu across the bottom?

# puzzle validation for additional rules

# dynamic number sizing to scale with grid size -- too small if no border cells

# check screen to list all individual checks

# menus to be handled for portrait mode, modal or from bottom
